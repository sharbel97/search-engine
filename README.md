# search-engine
 
Search engines are one of the most influential developments of the modern internet age, having completely revolutionized the way that people use and interact with the web. In this version of the search engine, each web page has a URL ("Uniform Resource Locator") that serves as its unique id and a string containing the body text of the page. The magic of search is enabled by pre-processing the body text of each page and storing the contents into a data structure optimized for fast retrieval of pages matching the search query.
